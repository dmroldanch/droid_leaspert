/**
[CommunityWallView]
is a composable function that represents a view for displaying a list of posts
in a community or feed in an Android application. It uses the [CommunityWallItemList]
function to retrieve a list of mock data for the posts and displays them using
the [LazyColumn] composable.

@Composable
fun communityWallView()

This function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values.
It simply calls the [CommunityWallItemList] function to retrieve the list
of posts and displays them in a vertically scrolling list, but it's already initialized
the view model that we are going to use

/**
[CommunityWallItemList] is a composable function that represents a list of posts in
a community or feed in an Android application. It retrieves a list of mock data
for the posts and displays them using the [LazyColumn] composable.

@Composable
fun CommunityWallItemList()

This function retrieves a list of mock data for the posts using the [listOf] function,
which contains instances of the [Post] data class. It then creates a [LazyColumn]
composable, which is a vertically scrolling list, and uses the [items] function
to iterate through the list of posts and create a [LpPostCard] composable for
each post. The [LpPostCard] composable is customized with the post's name,
image URL, time, and message using the properties of the [Post] data class.
It also takes optional modifiers, onClick events, and other parameters as needed.

This function is typically used as a UI component to display a list of posts in a
community or feed screen in an Android application, and it can be customized with
different data sources, UI styles, and behavior depending on the requirements of
the application.
